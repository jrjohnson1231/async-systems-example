Asynchronous Programming in Python
==================================

You will need to install the proper python packages. This easiest way is with `pip`:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

You might get an error install the `lxml` package, if this is the case Google how to install it on your machine.
Most Linux systems have a `python3-lxml` package that can be installed.
